# CausalModels_Literature
We will maintain on this repository a list of references we find valuable related to causal inference and their applications in the plant sciences. We will update this periodically, but the idea draws from our Annual Review of Phytopathology article. 

The repository will highlight books, code resources, and published journal articles we have used as part of our research as we explore the importance of causal inference and their applications in plant pathology and the agricultural sciences.
